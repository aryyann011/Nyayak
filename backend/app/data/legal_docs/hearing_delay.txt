Hearing Delay in Court Cases

Hearing delays in court cases are common due to multiple administrative and legal reasons.

Common Causes of Hearing Delay:
1. Heavy backlog of pending cases in courts.
2. Absence of judge or court staff.
3. Lawyer requesting adjournment.
4. Incomplete documents or missing evidence.
5. Transfer of judge or case file.
6. Strike or public holidays.

What Can a Citizen Do?
- Regularly check case status on the official court website.
- Request the lawyer to avoid unnecessary adjournments.
- File an application for early hearing in urgent matters.
- Approach higher court if delay is excessive.

In urgent cases such as domestic violence, bail, or medical emergencies, courts may prioritize hearings.

Understanding the reason for delay helps citizens take appropriate legal steps.
