Police Refusal to Register Complaint

If a police officer refuses to register an FIR, it is against legal duty in case of cognizable offenses.

Legal Remedies:
1. Approach higher police authority (SP or DCP).
2. Submit written complaint.
3. File complaint under Section 154(3) CrPC.
4. Approach Magistrate under Section 156(3) CrPC.
5. File complaint before Human Rights Commission (in serious cases).

Citizens should:
- Keep written proof of complaint.
- Record date and time of visit.
- Take acknowledgment receipt if possible.

Police refusal can be challenged legally, and higher authorities can direct registration of FIR.
