Tenant Rights and Legal Protection

Tenants have legal protection against unfair eviction and exploitation.

Basic Tenant Rights:
1. Written rental agreement.
2. Proper notice before eviction.
3. Protection from illegal eviction.
4. Refund of security deposit.
5. Peaceful enjoyment of rented property.

If Landlord Violates Rights:
- Send legal notice.
- File case in civil court.
- Approach Rent Controller.
- Seek police help in illegal eviction.

Landlord cannot forcibly remove tenant without court order.

Tenant disputes should ideally be resolved through proper legal channels.
