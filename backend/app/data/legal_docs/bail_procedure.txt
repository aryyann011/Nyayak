Bail Procedure in Criminal Cases

Bail is the temporary release of an accused person from custody, pending trial.

Types of Bail:
1. Regular Bail – Granted after arrest.
2. Anticipatory Bail – Applied before arrest under Section 438 CrPC.
3. Interim Bail – Temporary bail for short duration.
4. Default Bail – Granted when investigation is not completed within statutory time.

Steps to Apply for Bail:
1. Hire a lawyer.
2. File bail application in appropriate court.
3. Court hears both prosecution and defense.
4. Judge decides based on seriousness of offense and evidence.

Factors Considered by Court:
- Nature and gravity of offense.
- Criminal history of accused.
- Risk of fleeing.
- Possibility of tampering with evidence.

If Bail Is Rejected:
- Accused may approach higher court.

In bailable offenses, bail is a right.
In non-bailable offenses, bail depends on court discretion.
